              OUR HISTORY <p></p>
              Pard's Equalizer Trailer Hitch Co., Inc. was started in 1977 at
              Pard's backyard in Midvale, Utah. Although affectionately known as
              Pard, his name is actually Jerry Martin. Jerry was a millwright
              for 17 years before he retired his lunch box to start his own
              business. He started a hitch business because he had to get an
              equalizer set up on his father's car and he was not pleased with
              how the company set it up. His comment was "I need to start my own
              hitch business to make sure people are set up correctly when
              towing a trailer." So it was; now, 36 years later, Pard's
              Equalizer Trailer Hitch Co., Inc is still going strong. Pard made
              all of his own receiver hitches and ball mounts for several years.
              With the market changing, his clientele changed as well from
              needing receivers put on their vehicles to other items such as
              fifth wheel hitches, trailer repairs, running gears, couplers,
              springs, frame repairs, etc. Pard's Equalizer Trailer Hitch Co.,
              Inc has dealt with all the major hitch companies (i.e. Valley,
              Reese, Draw-Tite, B&W, Curt, Roadmaster, and Blue Ox). Pard
              designed the first bolt-on-receiver in 1978 and took it
              Louisville, KY to the largest RV show in the nation at that time.
              From that introduction, all the major hitch companies used his
              design and made similar hitches into their Class III designs. Pard
              has now taken the back seat and turned over the company to his
              son, Boyd Martin, who follows the same premises that his father
              has. Owner operated since 1977, Pard's Equalizer Trailer Hitch Co,
              Inc is known for doing exceptional work, repairing and maintaining
              trucks and trailers for a number of companies. We know our
